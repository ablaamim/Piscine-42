Because if we read the `man cat` page we see that this command just
*"concatenate files and print on the standard output"*. So is going to print
whatever we put inside the target file **z**, and in this case is only needed to
put a simple '**Z**' inside our file, using vim or nano.
You can also use echo command and redirection to redirect the character z inside the file Z.

### Example:

```
$> echo "A" > a
```

### Test:

```
$> cat a
$> A
```
